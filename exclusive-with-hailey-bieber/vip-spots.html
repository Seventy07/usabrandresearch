                     <p>
                        Hey, everyone! I've got some exciting news to share. As many of you know, I've been pouring my heart into Rhode, my baby in the fashion world. But guess what? I've been secretly brewing something else – a makeup line! Yep, you heard it right. I'm thrilled to announce that alongside Rhode, I'm launching my very own makeup brand.
                     </p>

<p>
Let me take you back a bit: when I was younger, I was introduced to USA Brand Research. They'd send me these cool samples to test out, and I was hooked. Fast forward to now, and here I am partnering up with them to bring you something special. See, USA Brand Research is that exclusive gem of a company that usually keeps to itself, only opening its doors to the public once in a blue moon. But guess what? They're opening up again, and this time, they want you to join as reviewers.
                     </p>


<p>Here's the deal – they'll send you makeup straight to your doorstep. All you've got to do is give it a whirl, fill out a simple online form sharing your thoughts, and voila, the makeup's yours to keep.</p>




                     <h1>What's the catch?!</h1>



                     <p>There's no catch, just a win-win situation for everyone involved. See, I used to be one of those reviewers with USA Brand Research, and it was like revisiting my childhood in the best way. But now, things have taken a different turn. Instead of being a reviewer, I'm on the other side as a brand owner.</p>

<p>
The thing is, this setup is a total win for both sides. Here's the beauty of it (no pun intended): makeup companies like the one I'm launching are eager for genuine, real-life feedback. They want to know what you think, how the products feel, and if they live up to the hype. And for you, well, you get to keep those makeup samples. It's like a sneak peek into the future of cosmetics, all from the comfort of your own space.</p>

<p>So, think of it as a partnership. You, sharing your thoughts and opinions, and in return, you get to experiment with some amazing makeup that's not even hit the stores yet. It's a fantastic way to shape the industry while building up your beauty collection. Trust me, it's as real as it gets!</p>


<h1>Now, here’s the thing:</h1>

<p>These spots are incredibly limited. By the time this piece lands in People magazine, chances are those spots will be snapped up faster than the latest trendy bag. But, don’t let that stop you from trying! Sometimes luck does favor the bold, and who knows, you might just secure one of those coveted positions. Keep your eyes peeled, stay tuned, and remember, sometimes taking a chance can lead to the most fabulous discoveries.


</p>

<p>

Thank you for being part of this journey. Your enthusiasm means the world to me. Let's keep spreading that positive energy and beauty vibes all around. Here's to hoping your makeup dreams come true! Cheers to a world of endless glam and happy faces!

                           Joined this program almost 6 months ago when they had some spots open, the form just takes a few minutes to fill out and the Makeup products are amazing. You can't choose which brand you want but I can completely understand that. This week I got Revlon Loreal, everything was un-opened and a nice selection of products overall.

                         Amazing program but have been trying to get my friends to join and they keep asking, but they are not open for new people very often. This is like maybe 20% of all the Makeup I have gotten thus far.

                         Always love getting Mac, just a quick screenshot was just sorting my makeup out, when you start with this program I highly recommend putting every brand together and separating the makeup you get.
