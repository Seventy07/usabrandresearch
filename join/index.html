                           Joined this program almost 6 months ago when they had some spots open, the form just takes a few minutes to fill out and the Makeup products are amazing. You can't choose which brand you want but I can completely understand that. This week I got Revlon Loreal, everything was un-opened and a nice selection of products overall.

                         Always love getting mac, just a quick screenshot was just sorting my makeup out, when you start with this program I highly recommend putting every brand together and seperate the makeup you get.

<p>
                        <strong>You will never be charged again,</strong> but we have rules to follow as we work closely with brands that don't want their pre-production products being sold online)</p>

After confirmation, you can expect your first Makeup samples to arrive within 2 or 3 business days, you will receive exclusive brands for FREE each week including shipping, all we need from you is a short form on your experience which you can send to us per email. </p>
